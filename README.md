## Contents

List of some common highly parallelizable algorithms that have been implemented is:

- Matrix addition with both 1D and 2D decompositions - OpenMP ([Lab2/matadd.cpp](./Lab2/matadd.cpp))
- 3 dimensional matrix multiplication - OpenMP ([HW3/3DMatMul.cpp](./HW3/3DMatMul.cpp))
- Prefix sum (subarray prefix sum - Hillis and Steele) - OpenMP ([Lab4](./Lab4))
- Matrix determinant by blocked right-looking LU factorization - OpenMP ([HW4/Q3.cpp](./HW4/Q3.cpp))
- Vector addition - CUDA ([Lab5/vectorAdd.cu](<./Lab5/Source Codes/vectorAdd.cu>)) - OpenMP and CUDA ([HW5/Q9.cu](./HW5/Q9.cu))
- Matrix multiplication (baseline and tilting with shared memory) - CUDA ([Lab6/matmul.cu](./Lab6/matmul.cu))
- Reduction sum - CUDA ([HW6/kernel.cu](./HW6/kernel.cu))



There is also a presentation about [Java Threading](./Presentation) which was presented by [Radin Shayanfar](https://github.com/radinshayanfar) and [MohammadErfan Ghasemi](https://github.com/erfanghasemi) in June 2021.



The instructions for each assignment are available alongside my reports in the assignment's directory.
